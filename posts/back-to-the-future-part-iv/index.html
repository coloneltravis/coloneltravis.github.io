The science of time travel is brilliantly simplified to the level of general understanding.  Apart from the occasional continuity slip, the paradoxes are demonstrated without the need of a PHD in quantum physics.</p>
<p>The first film mixed science fiction into a tale of romance, action and comedy.  The film could have easily stood alone in its own right, but it ended with the audiences yearning for a sequel.  They had explored the past, now it was the turn of the future.  A much harder task since no-one knows quite what advances will be made in 30 years.  Now that we have arrived in that time by the long route, we can see that there were a few predictions which did become reality.  However, flying cars remain in dreamland, clothing manufacturers are still safe from resizable clothes, Dominos Pizza is not threatened from hydrated pizzas and dogs can still be walked by their owners!  On the positive side, we do now have Skype for video calling, 3D films (although not qu ite holographic!) and antique computers!  You may have spotted that I have left out the hoverboard. Such a dream for skate park users everywhere to be free of wheels.  There are glimpses that this item may indeed may make he transition from fiction to fact.</p>
<p>The past and future done, where could they now go?  The answer was provided by a malfunction in the time machine and a bolt of lightning catapulting the Delorean back to the Wild West to set the scene for sci-fi to meet the western.  In my opinion, it was the new characters and plot in part three which turned the trilogy into a cult following with a massive fan base.  I was overwhelmed in the closing moments when a steam engine came rolling into 1985. The Doc had found a way to build a nuclear-free time machine with 19th centuries materials.  Once again the producers had provided opportunity to turn the trilogy into a saga, but so far that has been left in the hands of fan fiction.  </p>
<p>My own thoughts continue the trilogy to fill the missing gap of how the Doc developed the steam-powered time machine whilst exploring his feelings for Clara. Have a read of my own version of Back to the Future Part 4 on my <a href="https://www.fanfiction.net/s/9395160/1/Emmett-and-Clara">Fan Fiction</a> page.</p>
