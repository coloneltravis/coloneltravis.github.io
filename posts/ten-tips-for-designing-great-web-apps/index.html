You don&#39;t want to frustrate new visitors so they give up and go elsewhere.</p>
<p>You do want to make it as easy as possible for your visitors to find their way around to locate the information they require.</p>
<p>Once you have convinced visitors to sign up or pay for a subscription, you don&#39;t want the user interface to fail them at the last minute by being too strict, too slow or too complex.</p>
<p>Here are 10 tips for designing a great UI experience:-
<br/><br/></p>
<h3 id="1-clear-primary-action">1. Clear Primary Action</h3>
<p>Data entry forms can have two or more buttons to close the form. One button will save the data, another will close the form without saving and another may blank all the fields.  There may even be two different buttons to save data, one to submit it and one to save and return later.  It is useful for users to know to highlight the primary button which will actually complete their request.</p>
<p>For example, the two save options in bold will complete the form, so they should stand out to the user.</p>
<p>Cancel</p>
<p>Reset form</p>
<p><strong>Save and Continue</strong></p>
<p><strong>Save and Complete</strong></p>
<h3 id="2-identify-required-fields">2. Identify Required Fields</h3>
<p>Have you ever tried entering the minimum information into a form, only to be told that you have left some blank? Phone numbers are a good example - why should a company require a phone number as well as an email address?!</p>
<p>Identify which fields are required to complete the form. If these fields are left empty when the form is submitted, then a validation message should be displayed. The usual technique is to place a red asterisk next to the field label if the field will prevent the form being submitted if left blank.</p>
<h3 id="3-completion-steps-for-multi-tabbed-forms">3. Completion Steps for Multi-tabbed Forms</h3>
<p>Break up large forms into a collection of smaller forms with tabs. It should be clear to
the user which tab should be completed next.</p>
<h3 id="4-gradual-disclosure-of-information">4. Gradual Disclosure of Information</h3>
<p>Don&#39;t give users too much information overload on their first visit to your web site.
This can be achieved by show minimal information on the home or landing page with links to visit if they
require more information.  This puts the user in control of their own exploration of your web site, rather than getting a sense of being herded around the site like cattle.</p>
<p>Only showing areas of a web site which are relevant to the experience/access rights of the user.</p>
<h3 id="5-lazy-registration">5. Lazy Registration</h3>
<p>Relax the need to force new visitors to register. This will allow them time to try out some features before making a commitment. Even when no payment is required, surrendering your anonymity is sometimes considered as a non-monetary form of payment.</p>
<h3 id="6-forgiving-form-validation-">6. Forgiving Form Validation.</h3>
<p>Don&#39;t penalise users for entering, or not entering, data. Don&#39;t blank all fields for the sake of one omitted field. It can be very frustrating to have to re-enter fields for the sake of ticking a Terms &amp; Conditions box!</p>
<h3 id="7-breadcrumbs-and-navigation-">7. Breadcrumbs and Navigation.</h3>
<p>Don&#39;t make navigating your web site like walking through a maze without a ribbon. Provide a breadcrumb trail to show the pages a user visited before the current page. This will also prevent users from feeling lost or disoriented by your web site.</p>
<p>Similarly, once you have read a few pages, followed a few links, the easiest way to re-orient yourself is by clicking on the Home button. Sometimes this is easily achieved by clicking on the title or logo in the banner.</p>
<h3 id="8-account-registration">8. Account Registration</h3>
<p>Don&#39;t force users to register for an account merely to obtain their email address and demographics.
The primary reason for registering for an account should be to improve user experience by giving the user some control over their use of your application.</p>
<p>Some examples include:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Save items in shopping baskets</li>
<li>Regional and/or language settings</li>
<li>Re-use of archived or incomplete form data.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each time a user revisits the application, they will recognise it as their own. This will also help them to  identify whether their account has been hacked, since a hacker may have changed the appearance of their view of the application.</p>
<h3 id="9-clear-subscription-plans">9. Clear Subscription Plans</h3>
<p>Make any subscription / signup plans clear and easy to understand. A good plan would tie in to the overall branding of the web site.</p>
<ul>
<li>A financial investments site may use Saver, Casual Dealer or Stockmarket Trader.</li>
<li>A travel site may use Individual, Family, Group or Business.</li>
</ul>
<p>Web hosting plans usually use one of the following plans:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Bronze, Silver and Gold</li>
<li>Starter, Intermediate, Advanced.</li>
</ul>
<p>Each plan should be colour-coded with features clearly listed and comparable with other plans.</p>
<h3 id="10-reduce-clutter-on-small-screens">10. Reduce Clutter on Small Screens</h3>
<p>When viewed on a phone with a small screen, a responsive application will be optimised to make best use of the reduced size. Whilst it is important not to remove any features available, it is equally important not to let the screen become too cluttered.</p>
<p>A good trick is to hide buttons or text behind a dropdown section which can be revealed by dragging a bar down the screen. If a mouse cursor is available, then links may be displayed only if the cursor is hovering above them.</p>
