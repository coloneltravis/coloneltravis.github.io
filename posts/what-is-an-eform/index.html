Just as emails revolutionised the way we write letters to each other, eforms have saved us the arduous job of endless form filling.</p>
<p>These are just a selection of types of forms we use every day:-</p>
<ul>
<li>Job applications.</li>
<li>Surveys.</li>
<li>Questionaires.</li>
<li>Service signups.</li>
<li>Assessments.</li>
<li>Data collection.</li>
<li>Communication.</li>
<li>Content mangement.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="paper-forms">Paper Forms</h2>
<p>Historically, forms were designed on paper to  facilitate data capture.  A typical form consisted  of boxed spaces to guide you where to write your name, address and other details.  Paper forms were cumbersome to fill in, especially when they cover several pages.  Forms could become complex and difficult to complete accurately. Nowadays paper forms are keyed into a computer when they are processed, but in the past there was a side section reserved for &quot;office use only&quot; to allow for codes to be assigned so filing staff could locate them by flicking through a filing cabinet.</p>
<h2 id="faster-and-more-accurate">Faster and More Accurate</h2>
<p>Since eForms are computer-based, it is possible to auto-fill some information such as your name and address since these can be recalled from your computer once you type the first few letters.  Early data entry mistakes will be brought to the user&#39;s attention before they hit the send button.  A good eform will offer help to the user as they move from section to section.  No office only section is needed since form identification is handled by the database and retrieval is done by text searches.</p>
<p>eForms are a short-hand term for web forms which are part of the standard HTML set of elements.  Web forms bring true interactivity to a web page by providing us the opportunity to supply our own content rather than reading what someone else has written. All that is required to create a basic web form is a knowledge of HTML and a text editor such as Notepad and somewhere to send the captured data.</p>
<h2 id="html-web-forms-vs-xforms">HTML Web Forms vs XForms</h2>
<p>Using HTML as the base language for all forms, more complex forms build on this by making use of different technologies for styling, advanced form controls, security and validation. The <a href="https://www.w3.org/MarkUp/Forms/">W3C XForms</a> standard is an XML schema for designing an eform in a structured fashion. It uses the <strong>Model-View-Controller (MVC)</strong> design pattern which splits the data model of the form from the layout of the form controls. This allows for complex validation rules and other processing to be specified as the data is applied to the visual form controls.  Unfortuneately, the main web browsers do not directly understand the XForms markup, so forms need to be parsed using an XSLT stylesheet to convert them into HTML.</p>
<h2 id="uses-of-eforms">Uses of eForms</h2>
<p>Most complete web sites have at least a contact form which is the simplest type of eform. A contact form contains two or three fields for visitors to supply their name, email address and a quick message to the site owner.  Once a web site needs to handle users, then they need to provide a signup form and a login form which need to be very secure.  eCommerce sites use the same form technology to allow their customers to order their products.  Some of the biggest forms include marketing surveys, tax assessment and applications forms.</p>
<h2 id="form-builders">Form Builders</h2>
<p>Text editors are not the only way to design forms. Fortunately, there are lots of graphical form builders available to help build these forms easily:-</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.wufoo.com/">Wufoo</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.formstack.com/">Formstack</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.jotform.com/">JotForm</a></li>
<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/">Google Docs</a></li>
<li>and many more!</li>
</ul>
<p>Most content management systems will also offer some kind of form builder, whether it is built-in with the standard installation or it may be available as a plugin.</p>
<p>With the exception of Google Docs and a few CMS plugins, these form builders are not completely free. There will be a trial period or the ability to create a few forms with minimal controls, but this will limit only be enough for very basic forms. The form data collected from visitors will also be stored in their database and must be downloaded as a spreadsheet or using their report builder.</p>
<p>The form builders listed above are all <strong>Software-as-a-Service (SaaS)</strong> products hosted in the Cloud. Sometimes it pays to be able to download an open source product implementation which can be configured to suit your own needs.  There are some powerful graphical form builders based on the XForms standard which can be used to create enterprise class forms:-</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.orbeon.com/">Orbeon Forms</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.betterform.de/">BetterForm</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.agencexml.com/xsltforms">XSLTForms</a></li>
<li><a href="https://opendatakit.org/">OpenDataKit</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The most complete and popular XForms form builders are Orbeon and BetterForm. Both offer an open source minimal solution along with a complete professional edition, although Orbeon Forms has a more impressive list of customers.</p>
