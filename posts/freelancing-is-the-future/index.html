Will this become the trend in the future and will working for yourself provide a better life than under the umbrella of a large organisation?</strong></em></p>
<h3 id="safety-of-the-pay-cheque">Safety of the Pay Cheque</h3>
<p>For years, most workers have seen the 9 to 5 job as a safe income for life. You know where your next pay cheque is coming from, so you never have to think about winning new customers and orders. As employees, you can leave work at the end of a day and not think of it until the next morning.</p>
<h3 id="less-capital-to-develop-staff">Less Capital to Develop Staff</h3>
<p>Big companies have traditionally provided training and other opportunities to develop their staff throughout their careers, which has allowed them to be promoted up through the company rankings. More challenging market conditions and tighter budgets have forced companies to ignore the training incentive, causing employees to be stuck in the same job with little prospects of promotion.</p>
<h3 id="better-work-life-balance">Better Work/Life Balance</h3>
<p>Freelancing, however, gives you the flexibility to chose your own hours as well as the ability to train yourself to expand your future scope of opportunity. There is the caveat of the increased risk that the next pay cheque is not a guarantee, but this risk can be mitigated if a proper strategy and business plan are put in place. The growth of new Internet technologies has increased the number of jobs which can now be worked with a freelance rather than employed status.</p>
<h3 id="freelancing-benefits-all">Freelancing Benefits All</h3>
<p>The benefits of freelancing are not just a positive for the individual worker. Companies are increasingly seeing freelancing as a good way to save money by outsourcing in-house work. The costs of employing staff are much greater. At a minimum, freelancers do not require office space, national insurance, pension contributions and line management. Most critically though, freelancers are only paid for the time it takes them to do the work, where as full-time staff are paid thirty-seven or more hours per week when there may only be twenty hours of work available. When you look at these kind of savings on an annual basis, then it is easy to see why companies and public sector organisations see outsourcing as the solution to the financial constraints of the new economic climate. Freelancers are also likely to be much more dedicated to the task since they will always be looking for repeat work. Companies need to provide core staff for on-going work, but will also maintain a list of freelancers to call upon to handle excess workloads. It is a win-win situation for both the employer and the individual.</p>
<h3 id="create-your-own-job-security">Create Your Own Job Security</h3>
<p>As a freelancer, the risk of not finding work must be seen as your opportunity to expand your knowledge and skill set by keeping up with the market and identifying new areas to offer new services. Most skills can be gained by taking a foundation training course to achieve a level of certification. Sometimes, however, simply building up a portfolio of work which you can show to potential customers can be a better way to demonstrate your abilities. A common misconception about freelancing is that you have to be the &quot;best of the best&quot; in your chosen field, but this is not true. Good communication skills and working with the customer are the most important skills required by a freelancer.</p>
<h3 id="growing-freelance-market">Growing Freelance Market</h3>
<p>The number of freelance job categories is ever increasing as the Internet becomes more powerful. It&#39;s not necessary to be a software developer or writer to go freelance. It is now possible to carry out traditional office jobs such as help desk support, call centre operatives, data entry  and even a virtual personal assistant, all from your own four walls.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>If you think your job is heading for redundancy, or even would like to be free of the restrictions of an office job, don&#39;t be disheartened because freelancing is becoming the new <strong>job for life!</strong></p>
<p>Remember - no one can make you redundant as a freelancer!</p>
