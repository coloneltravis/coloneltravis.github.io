    <p>Here are some great walks which are suitable for buggies and wheelchair users.  All are fully accessible by public transport, so if you would like to explore a different area just hop on a bus or train to walk in a different area.  The following areas are ideal for planning walks from one to six miles.
<!--more--></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Bute Park</strong> is just a short walk up the river Taff from Cardiff Central station. Stretching from Cardiff Castle to Pontcanna, the park contains open spaces, good surfaced paths and many species of trees giving it status as an arboretum.  There are bus links all around the park so there are options for both linear and circular routes.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Grangemoor Park</strong> is a disused landfill site which has been covered with clay and turned into a nature reserve.  Take the bus to Cardiff Bay Retail Park which runs parallel to one edge of the park.  From the highest point, you are rewarded with a 360 degree view including the Senedd, the Millennium Stadium, the Barrage and St. Augustine’s church on Penarth Head.  The Ely river runs by on one side of the park, so if you feel like a longer walk you can follow Ely Trail as far as the next retail park at Leckwith.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Roath Park</strong> is a thin strip of land containing a Victorian boating lake.  The Scott memorial stands proudly at the head of the lake to commemorate the ill-fated Antarctic expedition.  There is a children’s adventure play area, a botanical garden and a natural woodland area at the far side of the lake.  There are bus stops all around the park which make it easily accessible from the city centre.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Cosmeston Lakes Country Park</strong> is located just to the south of Penarth.  Originally an old quarry works, the twin quarries have now been filled with water to create a beautiful lakeland environment both for humans and for wildlife. You can walk around both lakes, complete a figure of eight or just relax on the grass feeding the ducks.  If you fancy a trip back in time, there is a life-size replica of a 14th century Medieval Village which you can walk around and experience how our ancestors used to live.</p>

    <p>To get there, take the #94 bus to Barry via Sully and alight right outside the main entrance to the park which is shortly after the Harvester pub.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Swansea Bay</strong> is the gateway to the Gower peninsula.  The steel works of Port Talbot lie on one side, facing the tourist attractions of Mumbles on the other with the city of Swansea in the centre.  From Swansea railway station, head out of the city centre to the the Marina to find the start of  the cycle trail.  The cycle trail was built on the former route of the Swansea to Mumbles tramway which is famous as the first passenger rail service.  The views are staggering as you look ahead to Mumbles point with the pier and lifeboat station stretching out into the bay.</p>

    <p>The path to Mumbles is five miles long, but if you don’t feel you can walk the entire return trip, there are frequent bus stops along the main road running back to the city centre.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Forest Farm Nature Reserve</strong> is a haven for several species of birds along one of the last remaining stretches of the old Glamorganshire canal which transported coal from the Valleys to Cardiff docks.   Take the train to Radyr station, cross over the footbridge over the river and continue to head into Forest Farm.  The Melingriffith feeder canal runs parallel to the main canal before heading off to link with the river.  The canal continues through the woodland, passing through the ruins of an old lock before finally being cut off by the M4.  Herons, kingfishers and families of ducks make this a popular destination for photographers.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Treforest to Llantrisant</strong> is an east to west linear walk linking the Taff Valley to the foot of the Rhondda Valley.  There are spectacular views of Cardiff and the Vale of Glamorgan as the path runs parallell to the coastline. Take the #132 Stagecoach bus from Cardiff to Treforest, and return on the #122 bus from Talbot Green Retail Park at Llantrisant. The total length of the path is 6 miles, but you can always break the walk in Llantwit Fardre and take a bus to Pontypridd or Llantrisant.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Barry Island</strong> used to be the location for the only Butlins Holiday Village in Wales. Now closed and the land redeveloped as housing, Barry Island is the closest sandy beach to Cardiff.  The train runs all the way from Cardiff to the island.  Walk along the promenade, passed the coffee shops and arcades to proceed out to the head point of the bay.</p>

    <p>In recent years Barry Island has received a massive boost to its tourism value owing much gratitude to the Gavin and Stacey sitcom.  During your walk, try to see how many references to the show you can spot.  Relax with a coffee or ice cream at Marco’s cafe but you’ll be lucky if you are served by Joanna Page (aka Stacey)!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Taffs Well to Caerphilly</strong> is a small section of the Taff Trail which runs for 55 miles from Brecon to Cardiff.  The village of Taffs Well sits in between the Garth and Caerphilly mountains.  Infrastructure planners have fully taken advantage of the break in the high-level land created by the river.  Routes through the pass include a dual carriageway road and a double-track railway.  Another railway also used traversed the valley on the Walnut Tree viaduct, of which only one full pylon remains today.</p>

    <p>Take the train to Taffs Well and the Taff Trail (route 8) is well signposted opposite the main car park of the station.  There is a gentle gradient up hill, so be wary of cyclists free-wheeling downhill in the opposite direction.  When you reach the outer suburbs of Caerphilly, you can choose to continue on the east-west Celtic Trail (route 4) which will take you into the town centre.  The town centre is dominated by an impressive castle with a moat and drawbridge.  Also look out for the statue of Tommy Cooper who was born in Caerphilly – just like that!</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Risca to Crosskeys</strong> is a recently surfaced path running alongside a branch of the Brecon and Monmouthshire canal which runs from Crumlin to Newport.  Risca is located at the start of the Ebbw valley.  The town has experienced a lot of growth caused by its proximity to both Newport and Cardiff.
From the railway station at Risca follow the signs for the canal which runs on an embankment above the town.  This makes for lovely views the valley to your left.  You may be passed by several mountain bikers as they make their way to and from the off-road trails of Cwmcarn Forest Drive.</p>
