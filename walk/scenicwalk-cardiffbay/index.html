    <p><strong>Start:</strong> Cardiff Central – main Wood St. entrance.</p>

<p><strong>End:</strong> Cardiff Bay station</p>

<p><strong>Distance:</strong> 2.7 miles</p>

<p>A scenic walk following the river Taff from Cardiff city centre to the bay.
<!--more-->
This is a lovely walk leaving the centre of Cardiff and following the final section of the Taff trail to the modern developed area of Cardiff Bay, formerly known as Tiger Bay when it was one of the busiest coal mining ports in the world.  Now it has been redeveloped into a mecca for fine dining, high-class living, entertainment and a business hub.</p>

</a></p>

<p>Starting from the main line railway station, this walk will take you on a slightly less urban
to the waterfront area of Cardiff Bay.  The route starts by crossing the river to follow the Taff trail south in the edge of Grangetown, home to some of Cardiff’s ethnic minority communities and a regular filming location for Doctor Who and Casualty.  Most of the opposite bank of the river is taken up by the Brains brewery, the local beer for the Cardiff and much of the South Wales area.</p>

<p>Follow the Taff trail until you reach the Penarth road bridge opposite Big Yellow Self-Storage. Cross the road at the pedestrian crossing and continue until you reach the Clarence bridge, where you should cross the road and turn left across the bridge. Take the next right to follow the road along the opposite bank of the river. At the end of the road, go through the turnstile gate into Hamadryad Park. You now have the option of taking the direct route straight across the park or a slightly wider loop around the edge – both will emerge at another gate underneath the dual carriageway flyover.</p>

<p>Follow the path up to cross over the roundabout at the entrance to the yacht club, then  enter the Cardiff Bay Wetlands area.  This area has been designated to protect all the natural wildlife of the bay which has been established since the construction of the Barrage which caused the conversion of the area from a saltwater estuary to a freshwater lake.  You will exit the wetland area into the car park for the St. David’s Hotel which is one of the iconic landmarks for Cardiff Bay due to its impressive sail-design roof.  Walk through the car park and carry on until you reach the dockside of one of the remaining docks.</p>

<p>As you walk along the dockside, you will notice tracks in the paving which were used by loading cranes to move up and down the dock. Some of the cranes have been left in place to commemorate the former use of the area during the boom times of the coal industry.   At the end of the dock, follow the path around the dock to the right, walking passed Techniquest and the end of another dock and into the Mermaid Quay district of cafes, bars, restaurants, galleries and shops. A common meeting point for groups is outside the Terra Nova bar, named after the ship which sailed Captain Scott and his crew on their ill-fated expedition to Antarctica.  Its worth exploring the interior of the bar which is furnished as though it were an old sailing ship.</p>

<p>From the Terra Nova, continue to walk along the quayside until you reach a footbridge over the Oval Basin which was created out of an old dock.  This is where many seasonal events are held throughout the year.  It is also often referred to as “Torchwood HQ” after the fictional TV series had based its main  base underneath it.  Walk across the bridge towards the red brick Pierhead Building.  If you walk around the front of the building you will see the Senedd, the debating chamber for the Welsh Assembly.  All the slate used in building the Senedd was mined in the North Wales slate mines.
Now walk on the left side of the Senedd to face the side entrance of the Wales Millennium Centre which is used for concerts, plays, operas and a whole variety of other shows.</p>

<p>To return to Cardiff Central, there is a regular bendy-bus service from the bus stops next to the Millennium Centre.  If you prefer the train, then cross the road and continue walking along the pedestrian area until you see Cardiff Bay station ahead.</p>
