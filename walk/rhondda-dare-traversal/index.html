    <p>Starting at Cardiff Central, I took the 10:06 train to Treherbert.  After passing through Pontypridd station I noticed when the train entered <!-- more --> the Rhondda valley by station names like Trehafod, Porth, Tonypandy and Llwyn-y-pia.  The train paused at Dinas Rhondda station as the double-track line reduced to single track.  This required the driver to emerge from his cab to enter a small kiosk on the platform where he would phone for a token to allow the train to proceed on to the single track section.  It only proved as a reminder to the lack of funding in Wales for a modern railway. A passenger arriving in Wales from London must feel like the Severn Tunnel is some kind of time warp!</p>

<p><img src="/assets/images/rhondda-dare/Treherbert-1.jpg" alt="Treherbert" /></p>

<p>The train passed through Treorchy, the home of the famous Male Voice choir. Just one stop at Ynyswen before the train finally reached the end of the track at Treherbert at the head of the Rhondda valley.  From here, the track used to continue to loop around to the east to go under the mountains via the <strong>Rhonnda Tunnel</strong> which linked the Rhondda to the Llynfi valley.  The tunnel is now buried and the track removed, although there are hopes that the tunnel can be reopened as a cycle tunnel.</p>

<p>The station at Treherbert was not typical of a terminus station - with only a ticket kiosk and toilets available for passengers.  I walked straight on to the street to start walking through the streets of Treherbert.  I headed towards Penpych mountain which is distinctive with its flat plateau summit.</p>

<div>
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/rhondda-dare/01.jpg" />
  <figcaption>1. On leaving Treherbert Station, cross the road and take the first left. Follow this road to the end and round to the right.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div>
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/rhondda-dare/02.jpg" />
  <figcaption>2. Cross the bridge over a stream and turn left. Follow the path to a main road and turn left. You will see a sign for the neighbouring village of Tynewydd.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div>
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/rhondda-dare/03.jpg" />
  <figcaption>3. Walk along the road until you reach the Wyndham pub. You will see the impressive flat top of Penpych Mountain in the distance.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div>
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/rhondda-dare/04.jpg" />
  <figcaption>4. Turn right before the Wyndham pub and follow the road around to the left. When you reach some metal sheds, turn right.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div>
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/rhondda-dare/05.jpg" />
  <figcaption>5. Cross the stile on the left side of the gate and follow the path around to the left and up the bank.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div>
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/rhondda-dare/06.jpg" />
  <figcaption>6. The path goes up the bank to the left and then to the right, to bring you onto the footpath going up the hill. Follow this footpath uphill, crossing one stile, until you reach a junction point before a lot of bracken.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div>
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/rhondda-dare/07.jpg" />
  <figcaption>7. Proceed up the hill which will be covered with high ferns in the summer months and bear in the winter. Head for the right of the telegraph poles. There should be very faint signs of a footpath. Be careful of any sudden height changes in the ground.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div>
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/rhondda-dare/08.jpg" />
  <figcaption>8. Once clear of the ferns, walk up to the mound. Take the path to the right of the rocks to climb the mound. You will emerge by a sharp bend in a main road and a bench looking out over Treherbert.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div>
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/rhondda-dare/09.jpg" />
  <figcaption>9. Cross the road and head up the grass track. This goes up to the left, then it will bend back to the right and then to the left again, to emerge at a T-junction. Turn right here to continue heading up the valley.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div>
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/rhondda-dare/10.jpg" />
  <figcaption>10. Keep along the path on the edge of the valley, with a wooded area to your left and a stream in the valley below on your right. You may also notice the wreckage of a white car.
  </figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div>
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/rhondda-dare/11.jpg" />
  <figcaption>11. As you approach the top of the valley, you will notice a wooded area ahead of you. At a convenient point traverse the valley, crossing two streams. Take care as the land is very bumpy and difficult to see in the long grass. Head for the gap in the trees as in the photo.
</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div>
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/rhondda-dare/12.jpg" />
  <figcaption>12. Carry on through this path through the trees for approximately 100m until you see an opening heading uphill on the left. Proceed uphill to a wide gravel track.
</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div>
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/rhondda-dare/13.jpg" />
  <figcaption>13. Turn left and walk along the track.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div>
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/rhondda-dare/14.jpg" />
  <figcaption>14. As the track bends towards the left, take the more grassy track which branches right to continue straight along up the hill.
</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div>
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/rhondda-dare/15.jpg" />
  <figcaption>15. The track now emerges into a clearing where you will notice a triangulation point. At 516m, this is the high point of the walk. From the original path, proceed to the right to the trees at the edge.
</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div>
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/rhondda-dare/16.jpg" />
  <figcaption>16. Turn right and start to follow the main track back down the hill, but quickly branch off to the left when you see a narrow opening in the trees. Proceed down this corridor in the forest.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div>
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/rhondda-dare/17.jpg" />
  <figcaption>17. Cross the stream using the railway sleeper-made bridge and proceed through the tree-lined corridor.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div>
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/rhondda-dare/18.jpg" />
  <figcaption>18. At this point the path will emerge next to a wide gravel track. You have the option of following the track around, or proceeding on the grass to the far opening. If you take the path, be sure to look out for openings in the forest so you can rejoin the route.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div>
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/rhondda-dare/19.jpg" />
  <figcaption>19. If you proceeded through the forest from the last point, you will now emerge onto the same gravel track. Cross straight over and continue through the forest. If you chose to walk along the gravel track, turn right at this point.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div>
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/rhondda-dare/20.jpg" />
  <figcaption>20. The corridor now emerges into a clearing. Head carefully downhill to the path below, which continues slightly to the left.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div>
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/rhondda-dare/21.jpg" />
  <figcaption>21. Eventually the path will leave the forest at an old stone-arched bridge over a stream. Cross the bridge to the other side. This is about the halfway point, so you may like to use this opportunity to replenish your energy.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div>
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/rhondda-dare/22.jpg" />
  <figcaption>22. Cross the bridge, then the road. A water pipe runs down on the far side of the road from a reservoir. Where you see a black footprint on a white background painted on the pipe, step over and continue uphill on the path to your right. This is the Coed Morgannwg Trail, which is marked by the black footprints on waymark posts.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div>
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/rhondda-dare/23.jpg" />
<figcaption>23. Proceed under the double line of telegraph poles to the next waymark post.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div>
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/rhondda-dare/24.jpg" />
  <figcaption>24. Pass along the right edge of an old cattle-bathing pool. At each post, you should be able to see the next one in the distance. The trail is basically taking you towards a ridge, then bearing right along the edge.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div>
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/rhondda-dare/25.jpg" />
  <figcaption>25. Take the left-hand path to pass to the left of the waymark post. Follow the path along the edge of the hillside. On the left, you will notice spectacular views of the Dare Valley Country Park. If you turn around, you will see the cliff edge at the head of the valley.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div>
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/rhondda-dare/26.jpg" />
  <figcaption>26. Cross the stile and continue along the path.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div>
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/rhondda-dare/27.jpg" />
  <figcaption>27. The path gradually turns from a grassy track into a gravel one.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div>
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/rhondda-dare/28.jpg" />
  <figcaption>28. Leave the main gravel track by the path on the right. This will emerge into an open area.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div>
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/rhondda-dare/29.jpg" />
  <figcaption>29. Try and follow the path out into the open area, but try to bear left down the hill. You need aim to pick up a path to take you between the woods on your left and the slope of the hill on your right.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div>
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/rhondda-dare/30.jpg" />
  <figcaption>30. Pass through the woods to emerge into a large open field. Continue diagonally across the field to join a path at the far edge. Turn left on the path and head downhill to a tarmac road. A camp-site is on the other side of the road.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div>
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/rhondda-dare/31.jpg" />
  <figcaption>31. Turn right and walk along the road for approximately half a mile.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div>
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/rhondda-dare/32.jpg" />
  <figcaption>32. Look out for where the road crosses a bridge with black iron railings. Locate a path on the left which leads down onto a path heading through the woods.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div>
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/rhondda-dare/33.jpg" />
  <figcaption>33. Walk along the path through the woods. It will gradually head downhill. Try to keep to the left, as it does tend to branch off into the woods.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div>
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/rhondda-dare/34.jpg" />
  <figcaption>34. The wooded path will emerge onto a tarmac cycle track which used to be the bed of an old canal. Turn right and you will pass between the high walls of an old lock.</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>

<div>
<figure>
  <img src="/assets/images/rhondda-dare/35.jpg" />
  <figcaption>35. Follow the track until you reach a modern wooden bridge across the Dare River to arrive in Aberdare. Cross the car park next to the job centre and walk down the high street to the other side of town, which is where the railway station is located.</figcaption>
