    <p><strong>Start:</strong> Radyr railway station
<strong>End:</strong> Coryton railway station
<strong>Distance:</strong> 3 miles</p>

<p>Radyr is a picturesque village situated near the edge of a cliff over the river Taff.  Before the decline of the coal mining industry in South Wales, Radyr was one of the largest rail hubs in the area allowing coal trains from the Valleys to be re-routed between Cardiff, Penarth and Barry docks.  Now it is the junction point for the main Valley routes and the local City Line service.  The site of the old sidings has now been redeveloped into residential properties, though there are many remnants from the old railway days to be found in the area.</p>

  <img src="/assets/images/Radyr2Coryton_small.jpg" alt="Radyr to Coryton via Forest Farm Nature Reserve" />
</a></p>

<p>The route of this walk will actually close off the C-shaped route of the City Line train route to Coryton, by exploring the Forest Farm Nature Reserve, the Glamorganshire canal and a disused railway line to Coryton station.  Although from the map, the walking route is more like an S-shape.</p>

<p>Take the train from Radyr railway station to walk via Forest Farm to Coryton station.</p>

<p>As you head out of the station car park, take the steps down to the road and turn left to pass under the railway. Continue on and turn right through a kissing gate, the walk down the road to the Cricket Club.</p>

<p>The footpath passes in front of the clubhouse on the edge of the field so watch out for sixes if there is  match being played!  In the corner climb over into a lovely wild meadow. Here you have a choice of either following the path along the riverâ€™s edge or you can cut off the bend by taking
 a shortcut diagonally across the meadow to the railway bridge.On the other side of the river, continue down the path alongside the back of houses to emerge by the Melingriffith water pump.  This water pump has recently been restored.  Its original purpose was to pump water from the feeder canal to supply the main canal.  Turn left to walk on the pavement until you see the entrance to the Glamorganshire canal on the other side of the road.
The route now takes you between the main canal and the feeder canal, which makes for a very beautiful walk in all seasons.  There is also plenty of wildlife and birds to spot.  If you are lucky then you may see a few kingfishers.  Where the path splits, continue on the right to go passed an abandoned lock.  The path ends at a second lock where the M4 motorway has been built across the canal, forcing it to pass through a tunnel to reach Tongwynlais.  Walk across the tunnel entrance to ascend steps to the top of the cliff.</p>

<p>At the top of the cliff you will find a tall arched bridge spanning a disused railway cutting which has again been blocked off by the M4.  Descend down into the cutting and follow the old trackbed all the way to an identical arched bridge.  Just cross over the road to reach Coryton station.</p>
