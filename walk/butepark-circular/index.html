A refreshing walk around the Bute Park arboretum.</p>

<p>Bute Park is Cardiff’s answer to Hyde Park in London and Central Park in New York, providing green open spaces for city dwellers to walk, cycle, run and play.  The river Taff flows along the park’s border giving an idyllic riverside experience.</p>

<p><a href="/assets/images/ButeParkHorseshoe.jpg" data-lightbox="buteparkhorseshoe" data-title="Walk: Bute Park Horseshoe">
  <img src="/assets/images/ButeParkHorseshoe_small.jpg" alt="Bute Park Horseshoe" />
</a></p>

<p>Exit the rail station on the left and cross over the road at the pedestrian crossing. After crossing the river Taff, turn right to follow the Taff trail along the Taff Embankment northbound.  The Millennium stadium on the opposite bank is the home ground of the Wales rugby team with a seating capacity for 80000 people.  Continue walking passed the Nos Da hostel/bar as the path inclines slightly to join a gravel path.  This will take you underneath the Cowbridge road bridge and into Sophia Gardens on the other side.  Note that the path under the bridge may be impassable when the water level is high, so you may need to use the pedestrian crossing on the road above.</p>

<p>Follow the path up to the Millennium Footbridge which is one of the entry points into Bute Park on the other side of the river, however this route will continue along the western bank passed the Swalec Cricket stadium, through Pontcanna Fields to cross over at the Blackweir foot bridge.  This bridge is suspended so it has a tendency to sway if there is too much movement or weight on it!  Blackweir is the first of three weirs in the tidal section of the river, the other two being at Llandaff and Radyr.  It is a popular spot for picnics, fishing and swimming in the summer months.
After crossing the river, turn right through the iron gate to enter Bute Park from the northern entrance.  From this point, you can choose to either continue along the tarmac path or take the narrower path through the woods.  If you follow the main path, then you will see some impressive wood-carved sculptures out of fallen and standing tree trunks.  The main path will meander around the edge of rugby fields to bring you to the Arboretum area of the park which is host to a various species of trees. Once again, you have the option of walking amongst the trees and reading the information panels.  Return to the main path on the eastern side of the Millennium Footbridge where there is an outdoor cafe/bistro.
Following on the same side of the river, the path passes through the cultivate section of the park which is very colourful in the summer months.  When the path reaches forks, take the left-hand fork to cross Cooper’s Field which is sometimes the location for a circus, the Eisteddfod and other events.  On the right side of the path, there is a stone circle, though on a much smaller scale than Stonehenge.  Continue to follow the path in the same direction, passing the walls of Cardiff Castle on your right, to exit the park at the eastern gate.</p>

<p>Turn right to go down into the subway under the dual carriageway to emerge outside the Law Courts. Continue again to pass in front of the City Hall with the dome and then the National Museum of Wales.   Cross over the road and walk along Park Place, passed the Students Union until you reach Cathays station.</p>
